    <h1>Cruises</h1>
    <div>
      <p>Cruises are great if you don't have motion sickness. They are pretty pricey.
        But if you have the budget for it they are a great way to go to a country that might be too expensive to stay at.
        There is lots of activities. Tons of food choices and restaurants. Very relaxing and also not boring at all.</p></div>
