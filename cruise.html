        <h1>Cruises</h1>
      <p>Cruises are great if you don't have motion sickness. They are pretty pricey.
        But if you have the budget for it they are a great way to go to a country that might be too expensive to stay at.
        There is lots of activities. Tons of food choices and restaurants. Very relaxing and also not boring at all.</p></div>

          <div class="paragraph">
            <p>Bermuda was my favourite destination. I know multi destination cruises seem more appealing. You get to see more places but honestly
              going to Bermuda was the best. We actually got to dock overnight and discover the cities. We didn't have to rush back to the ship.
              I would chose one destination with a longer stay over multi-destination cruise anytime.
