    <h3>About me:</h3>
    <p> Here's a little bit about myself. I love to travel, discover new countries & cities.
    My grandma always says that I should travel as much as I can now because once I'm older I won't be able to go away as easily.
    I tend to go away at least 2-3 times a year. Love meeting new people, sight-seeing, relaxing and trying different types of food. </p>

        <p> Everyone has their preferences when it comes to travelling. Some people love to go on all inclusives,
          Some like going backpacking, some like backpacking.
          There are many positives and negatives to each type of travelling. I have made a list of the pros and cons
          of these 3 types. </p>
