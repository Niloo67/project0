    <h3>About me:</h3>
    <p> Here's a little bit about myself. I love to travel, discover new countries & cities.
    My grandma always says that I should travel as much as I can now because once I'm older I won't be able to go away as easily.
    I tend to go away at least 2-3 times a year. Love meeting new people, sight-seeing, relaxing and trying different types of food. </p>

        <p> Everyone has their preferences when it comes to travelling. Some people love to go on all inclusives,
          Some like going backpacking, some like backpacking.
