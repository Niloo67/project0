      <h3>Places to book:</h3>
      <p>It usually takes a bit of time and research to book an all inclusive trip. You can either use an agent or do your research yourself.
        I have used websites such as :redtag.ca, expedia.ca, and use tripadvisor to look at reviews. Also pay attention to pictures.</p>

        <h3>Things to look out for:</h3>
        <p> One thing to consider is that the hotel down south is that the hotel star ratings are usually lower than the US.
          Try and book something of 4 stars and above. The food quality is something to consider too. Some places don't have as much variety.
          Make sure you have transport to the resort and back to the airport. This is usually included in the packages but always good to check.
          Do not go during hurricane season it is not worth the risk.</p></div>

              <h3>Here are a few of my favorites:</h3>
              <p> I have been to all inclusives 3 times twice in Mexico and once in Dominican Republic.
              My favourite place was Los Cabos, Mexico. It was beautiful. It felt pretty safe everywhere. Some opted for pay as you go meals.
            But I would not. Even though the city has good food it is still very pricey and not worth it.
           We did an excursion in the city that we booked through our hotel. It was great. Do negotiate for prices.</p></div>
