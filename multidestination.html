      <p>I love these trips because you get to plan every little detail. Discover and do things as you want to. But at the end of the day
        it takes a lot of planning. I planned a trip to europe for 2 weeks. Looked up everywhere we needed to go. It was so much fun but it can't be planned last minute.
