    <h1>Multi-destination/self planned Vacations</h1>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>I love these trips because you get to plan every little detail. Discover and do things as you want to. But at the end of the day
        it takes a lot of planning. I planned a trip to europe for 2 weeks. Looked up everywhere we needed to go. It was so much fun but it can't be planned last minute.
      </p></div>
      <h3>Amazing food:</h3>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>I guess this depends on where you go. But trying out the local specialties and eating is always one of the best parts of the trip.
          For example Amsterdam pancakes that are savory or sweet or their fries.
          In vienna we had some delicious pasta. And in Prague we had this dessert smothered in nutella.
